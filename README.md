I am currently serving in the ROK Army to fulfill my mandatory service. With that being said, I’m taking gap years from Purdue for 2 years, and thought it’d be great to use this time to build a solid academic foundation and better myself in programming in general. Though the condition isn’t the best due to the constant night shifts and work duties as a fulltime Army soldier, I'm still grateful to be able to continue studying, and aim for 1~1.5 hrs to grind every day. - May 20, 2023

# Calculator in Java (May 2023)
--------------------------------------------
Built a calculator in online compiler. Currently am only working in online compiler as can't download IDE since I'm working on computers in my army base and they are sensitive on downloading stuff online. 
- Calculator takes two inputs from the user and would handle any invalid input or error. It also wouldn't exit itself unless the user commands it to do so. 
- Took me a good 2 weeks to get this one done from scractch, and was a good exercise to refresh and expose myself again to programming since last October when I enlisted. 
- Difficulty level: A weekly assignment for first year CS class, I'd say.
